The functions presented can be used to replicate the decision tree and spectra template development used to discern and categorize white-beaked dolphins from other dolphins and noise in Skagerrak in 2021. Paper forthcoming. 

This workflow uses functions from the PamBinaries and PAMpal R packages to extract binary information per click, and ICES standards for measuring underwater noise.
